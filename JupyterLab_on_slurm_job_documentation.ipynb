    "# Remote to a JupyterLab ran via Slurm job\n",
    "\n",
    "Often a researcher may not have the environment setup locally or may just not have the right machine to run the experiments. In my case, I have an Apple Silicon laptop which is not very compatible with the tools used. One can use an SSH file manager like [FileRemote](https://github.com/allanrbo/filesremote), git repository to synchronize code, rsync and or rclone to synchronize code and files. Personally, it causes a lot of wasted time trying to figure out how to work these tools or just even type in the commands. \n",

    "\n",
